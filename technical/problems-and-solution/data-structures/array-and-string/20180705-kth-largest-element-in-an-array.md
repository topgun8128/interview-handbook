## Problem

Find the **k**th largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4
```

**Note:**   
You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ array's length.

## Solution

### Verbal

**Method 1 \(Simple Solution\)**   
A Simple Solution is to sort the given array using a O\(nlogn\) sorting algorithm like [Merge Sort](http://geeksquiz.com/merge-sort/), [Heap Sort](http://geeksquiz.com/heap-sort/), etc and return the element at index k-1 in the sorted array. Time Complexity of this solution is O\(nLogn\).

**Method 4 \(QuickSelect\)**   
This is an optimization over method 1 if [QuickSort ](http://geeksquiz.com/quick-sort/)is used as a sorting algorithm in first step. In QuickSort, we pick a pivot element, then move the pivot element to its correct position and partition the array around it. The idea is, not to do complete quicksort, but stop at the point where pivot itself is kâ€™th largest element. Also, not to recur for both left and right sides of pivot, but recur for one of them according to the position of pivot. The worst case time complexity of this method is **O\(n2\)**, but it works in **O\(n\) on average**.

### Java

#### Solution 1 - Efficiency: O\(N log N\)

```java
class Solution {
    public int findKthLargest(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        return nums[nums.length-k];
    }
}
```

#### Solution 2 - Efficiency: Average: O\(2N\), Max: O\(N^2\)

```java

```
